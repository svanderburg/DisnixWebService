.SH NAME
disnix-soap-client \- Provides access to the disnix-service through the SOAP protocol
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B disnix-soap-client
\fI\,--target targetEPR operation \/\fR[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR] \fI\,paths\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The command `disnix\-ssh\-client' provides remote access to a `disnix\-service'
instance running on a machine in the network by using a SOAP/HTTP connection.
This allows the user to perform remote deployment operations on a target machine
through SOAP.
.PP
In most cases this command is not used directly, but is used by specifying the
\fB\-\-interface\fR option for a Disnix command\-line utility (such as `disnix\-env') or
by setting the `DISNIX_CLIENT_INTERFACE' environment variable. By using one of
those properties, the Disnix tools will use the given interface instead of the
standard `disnix\-client' which only provides loopback access.
